## What are Conditions?

* Conditions are cause and effect
* If This...Then...Do That




## Conditional Statement: A Real Life Use Case

* Conditional statements are part of our everyday life.
* As people, we can think about situations and make decisions based on what we observe.
* We commonly evaluate information around us and then choose one course of action or another:  
If the weather is nice, then I'll go for a walk. (It's implied that I won't go for a walk if the weather isn't nice.)





## Why Conditional Statements in Programming?

* Conditions are a crucial part of the decision-making process for computers
* Computers are machines that can't do anything without directing them
* So, we direct computers using conditional statements
* This tells the computer what to do and when to do




## Conditional Statement in Python

* In a Python program, the if statement is how you perform this decision-making. It allows for **conditional execution of a statement** or group of statements **based on the value of an expression**.
