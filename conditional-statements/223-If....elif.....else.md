## If Statement
* Syntax (how to write If statement in python?)- statement(s)  
   ```
   if test expression/condition:
      do this
   ```


* Here, the program evaluates the test expression and will execute statement(s) only if the test expression/condition is True.


* If the test expression is False, the statement(s) is not executed.

* In Python, the body of the if statement is indicated by the indentation. The body starts with an indentation, and the first unindented line marks the end.

* Python interprets non-zero values as True (even negative values).

* None and 0 are interpreted as False.

* Empty strings, empty lists, empty dicts, empty tuples, and empty sets are also interpreted as False.

Example: Python program to detect if a number is even. (% sign tells us the remainder of an expression. Any number with a remainder of 0 after dividing by 2 must be even.)

## If-else Statement
* Syntax:
```
if test expression:
  Body of if
else:
  Body of else
```
* The if..else statement evaluates test expression and will execute the body of if only when the test condition is True.
* If the condition is False, the body of else is executed. Indentation is used to separate the blocks.

The test expression is False as 5 is not an even number. So the body of if statement is not executed. The body of else is executed

## if-elif-else Statement
* Syntax:
```
if test expression:
  Body of if
elif test expression:
  Body of elif
else:
  Body of else
```
* The **elif is short for else if.** It allows us to check for multiple expressions.
  * If the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on.

* If all the conditions are False, the body of else is executed.
* Only one block among the several if...elif...else blocks is executed according to the condition.
* The if block can have only one else block. But it can have multiple elif blocks.

5 is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3. So the if and elif statements are False. The else block will be executed here.

**Now let’s try to understand the given example.**
  * We first assigned the value 5 to z.
  * The control shifts to the next line where z%2 is checked. 5 is not divisible by 5 and so the control doesn’t shift to the body of if.
  * Then, the elif statement: z%3 is executed. Since 5 is not divisible by 3, the body of elif is not executed.
  * Finally, the else statement is executed and the control shifts to the body of the control statement. The print statement (“z is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3” is executed.
  * Point to be noted: The conditions are checked in a top to bottom order. If any of the above if or elif condition is True, it’ll be executed and no further conditions will be checked.
  * Can you figure out what will z=6 print in the given example?
