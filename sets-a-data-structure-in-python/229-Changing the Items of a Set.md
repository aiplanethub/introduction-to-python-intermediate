## Learning Objectives

* Adding items in a Set

* Removing items from a Set

* Getting the length of a Set

* Union and Intersection of two Sets

## Add An Item In A Set

* **add()**: Used to add one item at a time in a set.

### Add More Than One Item In A Set

* **update(): Used to add more than one item at a time in a set.**

Note: update() method can also add one item to a set. Try this by yourself!

## Remove an Item from a Set

* **remove()**: Used to remove an item from a set

Note: If we try to remove an item not present in the set, the remove() method will raise an error.

* If the item is not present in the set, the discard() method will not raise an error.

## Getting The Length Of A Set

To determine the number of elements present in the set, we can use len() method.

## Joining Two Sets

There are different methods to join two sets in Python.

* **update()** method helps you add the items of one set to another.
* **union()** method returns a new set containing all items appearing in either one set, the other, or both sets.
* **intersection()** method returns a new set containing all the common elements in the two sets.

The update method has already been covered before. Letâ€™s have a look at union and intersection now.

### union()

Note: The union operation can also be performed as:  
s3 = s1 | s2

**Do It Yourself:** Join these two sets using union:

S1 = {1, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3} and S2 = {2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7}. Observe the output after joining these sets.

### intersection()

**Note**: The intersection operation can also be performed as:  
s3 = s1 & s2

**Do It Yourself:** Join these two sets using intersection():

S1 = {1, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3} and S2 = {2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7}. Observe the output after joining these sets.
