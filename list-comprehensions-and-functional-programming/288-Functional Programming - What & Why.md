## Learning Objectives

* What is Functional Programming?
* Why Functional Programming?

## Functional Programming

* Functional programming is a coding paradigm in which we define what to do instead of performing actions.

* Here, we define the inputs that go into the function and the output that we expect from it.

* You should have started getting the feel. You already know how to define functions from the course - **‘Introduction to Python Basics for Data Science.’**

## Why Functional Programming?

* It helps you avoid writing the same set of code again and again
* Once you have defined a set of instructions to do certain task, you can just call the same function wherever you want to perform the same action.
* Codes are more manageable and organized

## Functional Programming

* Other than the ‘user-defined function’ that you learned in the course - **‘Introduction to Python Basics for Data Science’** there are some other functional programming concepts.
* map(), filter(), lambda, etc.
* You will learn these three functional programming in upcoming topics.
