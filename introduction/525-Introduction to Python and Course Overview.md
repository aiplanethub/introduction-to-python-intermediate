1. What is Python?
2. Why Python for Data Science?
3. Course Overview



## What is Python?

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It gained prominence owing to its simplicity and ease of use. Its syntax is very similar to the English language.

It is an open-source, free-for-use tool with a vast community that contributed over 70K+ libraries. This rich set of libraries makes coding easy for developers and data scientists. Often libraries replace long codes with fewer lines of code.



## Why Python for Data Science?

* Free and open source
* Great community
* Plenty of libraries for Data Science & Machine Learning
* Easy and intuitive to use

**Note**

* Data Science is not about programming languages/tools such as Python, R, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc.
* Data Science is using the above tools and techniques and, if required, inventing new tools and techniques to solve a problem using “data” in a “scientific” way.



### Important Guideline

* **Never memorize code!!**
* Below is the response to the question **“Do we need to memorize code?”**
