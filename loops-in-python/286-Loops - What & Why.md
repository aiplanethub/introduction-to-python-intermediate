## What Is A Loop?

* A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continuously repeated until a certain condition is reached.

## Loops - A Real Life Example

* Think about a teacher taking attendance. The teacher calls out a name, and the student responds present.
* The teacher is going through the list of students one by one and calling a name to get “present” if the student is present or \<silence> if they are absent.
* This process will only end when the whole list of students is completed. This will be the condition that will break out of the loop.

## Loops In Programming

* Loops are programming elements (or a set of programming instructions) that repeat a portion of code.
* This portion of code is repeated several times until a process is complete.

## Why Loops In Programming?

* Loops are needed in programming to repeat the same task more than once.
* It helps you get rid of writing the same code repeatedly to perform similar operations.
* Loops help you make your code more manageable and organized.
* Let’s look at the types of loops in Python in the next section!
